# file-size-list-generator

A simple script to enumerate file directories and then sort the files from largest to smallest.
This script was made to simplify the user in managing files especially deleting large unwanted files.

I tested with tree command on windows cmd for this pre-made folder 'C:\walktest':

output of script:

The script lists all files (not folders) with the size accurate to bytes.
The chosen filepath in the output can then be easily used as a search term to quickly get to the file for deletion.
